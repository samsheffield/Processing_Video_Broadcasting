Processing_Video_Broadcasting
=============================

Sending and receiving video over a network with Processing 2.0+. Almost entirely based off of [some old code](http://shiffman.net/2010/11/13/streaming-video-with-udp-in-processing/) by Daniel Shiffman. I mostly just updated it to work with Processing 2.0, and then broke it into helper classes which make the whole thing seem less intimidating.

This was mainly a response to recent requests from a handful of students who all found themselves needing this kind of thing for something or other at roughly the exact same moment. Consequently, it isn't well tested, nor particularly robust, and will (in all likelihood) probably break at the worst possible moment. Good luck!
